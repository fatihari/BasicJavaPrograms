## 16-LeapYearCalculator
The program is designed to find whether the year the user entered is a leap year or not.

There are two rules:
>Leap years are years that are a multiple of 4, such as 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020.
>
>If a multiple of 100 is divisible by 400 without a remainder, that is, 1200, 1600, 2000, etc., it is a leap year.
