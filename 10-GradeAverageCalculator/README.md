## 10-GradeAverageCalculator

A simple program was prepared that calculates the grade point average of the courses with the **if condition**. 
> If the average score is below 55, it will be written "Failed in Class", and above it, "Passed the Class". 
> 
> If the entered course grade is not between 0 and 100, the grade will be assumed to be 0.
